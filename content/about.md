## **Personal**:
In my free time, I like to hang out with my dogs, play video games, work on my [personal projects](../projects/), and generally goof off.

Dogs are the best, so here are some pictures of my boys :)

## **Education**:
I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford. My focus is in **systems**, such as Operating Systems, Compilers, Digital Architecture, Parallel Computing, Networking, Security, etc. For a list of coursework I have completed, take a look at the [coursework](../coursework/) page. 

## **Professional**:
I also have extensive industry experience via several internships and long-term co-ops.  I have worked in varying environments, such as big-business, as well as small technology startups of under 30 people. In one of these experiences, I worked as part of a long-term team toward many short and long-term goals over the course of 2 years, of which 1.5 years were full time. At another position, I was able to own the beginning of an entire feature that was critical to the product infrastructure optimization, and was immediately continued by the company after my internship ended.

If you would like to speak more in-depth about my previous professional experience, feel free to reach out via one of my social media on the front page.
