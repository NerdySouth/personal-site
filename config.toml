  Hi, my name is Tristen Nollman! I am a senior at Stanford University studying
  Computer Science üíª, with a focus in Systems and Securityüîí. I am currently looking
  for new graduate positions in software engineering.

  Skills:
    ‚á¢  Proficient in Rust ü¶Ä, C, C++, Python3, Cython, Zig
    ‚á¢  Familiar with deploying to AWS Lambda via CloudFormation
    ‚á¢  Familiar with Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes
    ‚á¢  Familiar with AArch32 and AArch64 platforms, both with linux and bare metal.
    ‚á¢  Familiar with common peripheral interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, Etc.
  
  Checkout my LinkedIn, and CV for more info on my past experience, projects,
  and open source contributions.

  In my freetime I like to work on Nox, and Zoot, two hobby projects for 
  learning more about the AArch64 Architecture, as well as novel OS design on 
  real hardware. I am writing Nox in Rust, and Zoot in Zig, two new systems languages.
  I really like the idea of pushing as much as we can onto language's like these
  to ensure correct program behavior within an OS. Check out my blog and my github 
  for more info! 

  Outside of CS I love to hangout with my two dogs üêï, watch anime and sci-fi showsüõ∏,
  and be out in natureüåø.

  Nice meeting you!
  Lets me get you some links to check out...  :p
